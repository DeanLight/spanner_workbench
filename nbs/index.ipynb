    "The spanner workbench is an interpreter and a REPL system for spanner-like languages. Our goal in developing the spanner workbench is twofold:\n",
    "\n",
    "* First and foremost, to allow students learning about spanner languages an easy to use system to play around with the languages.\n",
    "* A later goal is to provide an easily modifiable framework that allows researchers to easily test and deploy new algorithms and optimizations to spanner languages.\n",
