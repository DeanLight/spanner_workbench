    "\n",
    "    The main idea behind this class is that it uses the `term_graph` to understand how relations are related to\n",
    "    one another, and thanks to that information, it is able to execute the commands in the `parse_graph`.\n",
    "    for example, let's say the parse graph looks like this:\n",

    "    ```prolog\n",
    "    (root) -> (query relation a)\n",

    "    then it will copy `union_b_c` into `a`, and finally it will query `a` and return the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "    more precisely, the execution traverses the parse tree, when it reaches a query node it compute the relevant\n",
    "    relation using the term graph (i.e. if the query is `?A(X)` it will compute the relation `A`).\n",

    "        During the traversal, when we reach a root of another rule relation, we build its computational graph as well.\n",
