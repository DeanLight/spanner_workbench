# Covid-19 NLP Pipeline
### Tutorial Introduction:
In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of re-writing an existing data pipeline into the rgxlog framework, allowing you to witness a real-world example of the framework's benefits. And to offer further tutorials on advanced applications of the rgxlog framework.
We've chosen to adapt a pipeline from the field of NLP, specifically the Covid-19 NLP pipeline, which was a part of a published [paper](https://aclanthology.org/2020.nlpcovid19-acl.10.pdf) in 2020.

### Understanding The Covid-19 NLP Pipeline:
The pipline repository [link](https://github.com/abchapman93/VA_COVID-19_NLP_BSV/).


The primary objective of the NLP pipeline is to identify individuals who have been positively diagnosed with COVID-19 by extracting pertinent information from unstructured free-text narratives found within the Electronic Health Record (EHR) of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). By automating this process, the pipeline streamlines the screening of a substantial volume of clinical text, significantly reducing the time and effort required for identification.
The pipeline is built on medSpacy framework, and defines a new UI to use.

### Pipline Stages:
![image-6.png](covid_pipeline_files/image-6.png)
- preprocessor: Modifies the preprocessed text
- concept tagger: Assigns a semantic tag in a custom attribute to each Token, which helps with concept extraction and normalization.
- target matcher: Extracts spans using rules, based on the concept tagger.
- sectionizer: Identifies note section headers in the text and assigns section titles to entities and tokens contained in that section.
- context: Identifies semantic modifiers of entities and asserts attributes such as positive status, negation, and other experiencier.
- postprocessor: Modifies or removes the entity based on business logic. This handles special cases or complex logic using the results of earlier stages.
- document classifier: Assigns a label of "POS", "UNK", or "NEG" to each file, A document will be classified as positive if it has at least one positive, non-excluded entity
We will explain about each stage in more details later on.

At each stage, we encountered unique challenges. Each stage involved working with different classes and medSpacy framework attributes. Our approach was to first understand the original implementation, seek opportunities to simplify it, and then rewrite it in rgxlog. What was possible we wrote it declaratively using rules, facts, and queries. Additionally, if any essential functionalities were missing in the library, we built IE functions.
As we mentioned the pipline uses medSpacy framework so first we need to import some libraries and install some requirements.

### Setting Up The Environment:

We need to install some requirements to work with [medspacy](https://github.com/medspacy/medspacy) framework

<a id='concept-tag-rules'></a>
### [Concept Tagger](https://github.com/abchapman93/VA_COVID-19_NLP_BSV/blob/master/cov_bsv/knowledge_base/concept_tag_rules.py):
Concept tag rules, also known as pattern-based rules or custom rules, are a way to specify and define patterns that an NLP (Natural Language Processing) system should recognize within text data. These rules are used to identify specific concepts or entities within text documents. In the context of MedSpaCy and medical NLP, concept tag rules are often used to identify medical entities and concepts accurately.

In the orginal project they used the TargetRule class which defines a rule for identifying a specific concept or entity in text.
each concept Target Rule looks like this:

TargetRule(
            literal="coronavirus",
            category="COVID-19",
            pattern=[{"LOWER": {"REGEX": "coronavirus|hcov|ncov$"}}],
          )

**Literal** : This specifies the literal text or word that this rule is targeting.

**Category** : This specifies the category or label associated with the identified entity.

**Pattern** : This defines the pattern or conditions under which the entity should be recognized. It's a list of dictionaries specifying conditions for token matching. These rules some times used lemma attribute or POS of each token. A documentation can be found at : https://spacy.io/usage/rule-based-matching.

Instead what we did is to define regex patterns, we have added these pattern in concept_target_rules.csv file, there are two types of these patterns lemma and pos, that we will implement each later on.
Each rule in the csv file is like this : regexPattern, label, type


```
print_csv_file('concept_tags_rules.csv')
```

```

#### Lemma Rules:
Lemma rules are rules that used the attribute _lemma of each token in the NLP, we already lemmatized the texts, so now we can create a regex patterns for that.

Example for a lemma rule from the original NLP:

        TargetRule(
            "results positive",
            "positive",
            pattern=[
                {"LOWER": "results"},
                {"LEMMA": "be", "OP": "?"},
                {"LOWER": {"IN": ["pos", "positive"]}},
            ],
        ),
We used the py_rgx_span to capture the patterns, and will use the spans later on in replace_spans that will replace each span with the correct label


```
%%rgxlog
LemmaMatches(Label, Span, Path) <- FilesContent(Path, Content), ConceptTagRules(Pattern, Label, "lemma"), py_rgx_span(Content, Pattern) -> (Span)
```

```

#### POS Rules:
As we mentioned above these rules used the POS attribute of each token, there were a small number of rules so we only used this to the tokens we needed.
Example of the a rule from the original NLP:

        TargetRule(
            "other experiencer",
            category="other_experiencer",
            pattern=[
                {
                    "POS": {"IN": ["NOUN", "PROPN", "PRON", "ADJ"]},
                    "LOWER": {
                        "IN": [
                            "someone",
                            "somebody",
                            "person",
                            "anyone",
                            "anybody",
                        ]
                    },
                }
            ],
        ),

The patterns we've defined will match words listed under "IN", We specifically capture words if their Part-of-Speech (POS) falls into one of the categories: ["NOUN", "PROPN", "PRON", "ADJ"]. To accomplish this, two functions are employed: the first function determines the POS of each token, and the second one, py_rgx_span, captures the predefined patterns. After matching words, We confirm the accurate POS tags of the matched words using spans.


```

    """
    This function reads a text file, processes its content using spaCy's English language model,
    and returns a tuple of (POS, Span) for each token if it's one of NOUN|PROPN|PRON|ADJ

    Parameters:

            yield token.pos_, Span(token.idx, token.idx + len(token.text))
        else:
            yield tuple()
magic_session.register(ie_function=annotate_text_with_pos, ie_function_name = "annotate_text_with_pos", in_rel=[DataTypes.string], out_rel=[DataTypes.string, DataTypes.span])

### [Target Rules](https://github.com/abchapman93/VA_COVID-19_NLP_BSV/blob/master/cov_bsv/knowledge_base/target_rules.py):
These rules used the label that was assigned through the concept tagger, to capture some more complex patterns and assign a label for them inorder to decremnt the cases of false positive.
Each rule look like this:

        TargetRule(
            literal="coronavirus screening",
            category="IGNORE",
            pattern=[
                {"_": {"concept_tag": "COVID-19"}},
                {"LOWER": {"IN": ["screen", "screening", "screenings"]}},
            ],
        ),
Since we replaced the spans we found with the corresponding label we didn't need the concept_tag attribute of the token/span.

**Literal** : This specifies the literal text or word that this rule is targeting.

**Category** : This specifies the category or label associated with the identified entity.

**Pattern** : This defines the pattern or conditions under which the entity should be recognized. It's a list of dictionaries specifying conditions for token matching. These rules some times used lemma attribute or POS of each token. A documentation can be found at : https://spacy.io/usage/rule-based-matching.

Similar to the concept tag apporach we defined regex patterns, we have added these pattern in target_rules.csv file
Each rule in the csv file is like this : regexPattern, label


```
print_csv_file('target_rules.csv')
```

<a id='section-rules'></a>
### [Section Rules](https://github.com/abchapman93/VA_COVID-19_NLP_BSV/blob/master/cov_bsv/knowledge_base/section_rules.py):
Here, we'll add a section detection component that defines rules for detecting sections titles, which usually appear before a semicolon.
Section rules are utilized to identify specific section names, enabling the separation of text into different parts. Entities occurring in certain sections are considered positive.

In the original project, the SectionRule class was used to define rules for identifying specific section text. Each SectionRule has the following structure

      SectionRule(category="problem_list", literal="Active Problem List:"),
      SectionRule(category="problem_list", literal="Current Problems:"),
    
    
**Literal** : This specifies the literal section text or word that this rule is targeting.

**Category** : This specifies the section category associated with the identified section.




Similar to the approach used in the concept tagger stage, regex patterns were derived from these literals, and these patterns are stored in the 'section_target_rules.csv' file and are used to match section texts and replace them with their appropriate category.

Each rule in the CSV file follows this format: regexPattern, sectionLabel


```
print_csv_file('section_rules.csv')
```

### Attribute Assertion:

 Next, we will explore how to assert attributes indicating whether a mention of COVID-19 is positive or not. In our project, we have created a table     named 'CovidAttributes' that contains all attributes for each COVID-19 mention. This table will be used for classifying documents.


```
%%rgxlog
#Here, we employ a pattern to identify entities present in specific sections and mark them as positive,
#and adding them to the 'CovidAttributes' table.

pattern = "(?i)(?:diagnoses :|observation_and_plan :|past_medical_history :|problem_list :)(?:(?!labs :|addendum :|allergies :|chief_complaint :|comments :|family_history :|hospital_course :|imaging :|labs_and_studies :|medications :|neurological :|other :|patient_education :|physical_exam :|reason_for_examination :|signature :|social_history :).)*"
new SectionRulesAttribute(str, str)
SectionRulesAttribute(pattern, "positive")

SectionMatches(Path, Span, CovidAttribute) <- FilesContent(Path, Content), SectionRulesAttribute(Pattern, CovidAttribute), py_rgx_span(Content, Pattern) -> (Span)
?SectionMatches(Path, Span, CovidAttribute)

CovidMatches(Path, Span) <- FilesContent(Path, Content), py_rgx_span(Content, "COVID-19") -> (Span)
?CovidMatches(Path, Span)
```

    printing results for query 'SectionMatches(Path, Span, CovidAttribute)':
        Path     |  Span   |  CovidAttribute
    -------------+---------+------------------
     sample3.txt | [0, 76) |     positive

     sample5.txt |  [9, 17)
     sample6.txt | [26, 34)
    
    


```
%%rgxlog
SectionCovidAttributes(Path, CovidSpan, CovidAttribute) <- SectionMatches(Path, Span1, CovidAttribute), CovidMatches(Path, Span2), is_span_contained(Span1, Span2) -> (CovidSpan)
?SectionCovidAttributes(Path, CovidSpan, CovidAttribute)
```

### Tokenizing the Text into Sentences:

In the subsequent stages, where attributes are assigned to COVID-19 mentions, a departure from the previous stages occurs. Here, patterns are no longer applied to the entire text, instead, they are applied at the sentence level, since the attributes of COVID-19 mentions are typically determined by the context of the sentence in which they appear. This means the text is processed and tokenized into sentences using spaCy's English language model. This process is accomplished through the use of  ie functions and relations.


```
%%rgxlog
#Sentences of the text
Sents(Path, Sent) <- FilesPaths(Path), sent_tokenization(Path) -> (Sent)
?Sents(Path, Sent)

#SentSpan is the span of the sentence in the text
SentSpans(Path, Sent, SentSpan) <- FilesContent(Path, Content), Sents(Path, Sent), py_rgx_span(Content, Sent) -> (SentSpan)
?SentSpans(Path, Sent, SentSpan)
```

    printing results for query 'Sents(Path, Sent)':
        Path     |                                        Sent

### [Context Rules](https://github.com/abchapman93/VA_COVID-19_NLP_BSV/blob/master/cov_bsv/knowledge_base/context_rules.py):
These rules assign an attribute for each COVID-19 label based on the context, these attributes will be used later to classify each text.

Example for this rule is: 

    ConTextRule(
        literal="Not Detected",
        category="NEGATED_EXISTENCE",
        direction="BACKWARD",
        pattern=[
            {"LOWER": {"IN": ["not", "non"]}},
            {"IS_SPACE": True, "OP": "*"},
            {"TEXT": "-", "OP": "?"},
            {"LOWER": {"REGEX": "detecte?d"}},
        ],
        allowed_types={"COVID-19"},
    ),
   **direction** specify if the allowed_types should be before or after the pattern,
   **allowed_types** specify on what labels should this rule be applied on 


```

### [Postprocessor](https://github.com/abchapman93/VA_COVID-19_NLP_BSV/blob/master/cov_bsv/knowledge_base/postprocess_rules.py):
The postprocessor is designed to apply extra adjustments to the processed text using custom logic or specific requirements not addressed by the spaCy pipeline. These rules modify, remove, or change attributes for each mention of COVID-19 based on either their existing attributes, the context of the sentences in which they appear, or a combination of both. This flexibility allows us to address data issues and implement targeted improvements. For instance, it proves useful in identifying and rectifying incorrectly labeled positive cases, thereby enhancing the accuracy of our classification.

**How we implemented it:**  
As mentioned earlier, postprocess rules are responsible for modifying, removing, or changing attributes for each mention of COVID-19. In the original project, these attributes are represented as boolean variables stored in an object class for each COVID-19 mention. The rules simply switch the corresponding boolean variable to assign or remove the attribute. However, in rgxlog, we don't have the luxury of creating classes. In our project, when we want to remove a specific attribute, we introduce an additional attribute that acts as its negation. For instance, for the attribute 'positive,' we add 'no_positive,' causing the document classifier to behave as if there is no positive attribute.

Additionally, in some cases, the entire COVID-19 mention is removed by eliminating its object. In our project, we introduce an 'IGNORE' attribute, which results in the exclusion of the mention from consideration in the document classifier stage.
<br>

**In the subsequent cells, we will explore three types of postprocess rules:**
1) Rules based on patterns
2) Rules utilizing existing attributes and patterns
3) Rules applied to the next sentence.

#### 1) Postprocess rules based on patterns:

Example rule in the original project:

```
PostprocessingRule(
        patterns=[
            PostprocessingPattern(lambda ent: ent.label_ == "COVID-19"),
            PostprocessingPattern(
                postprocessing_functions.sentence_contains,
                condition_args=({"deny", "denies", "denied"},),
            ),
            PostprocessingPattern(
                postprocessing_functions.sentence_contains,
                condition_args=({"contact", "contacts", "confirmed"},),
            ),
        \],
        action=postprocessing_functions.remove_ent,
        description="Remove a coronavirus entity if 'denies' and 'contact' are in. This will help get rid of false positives from screening.",
    ),    
```
This rule iterates through each entity and checks a series of conditions which are the "PostprocessingPattern". If all conditions evaluate as True, then some action is taken on the entity, which is 'remove' action in this example.


In our case, we assign "IGNORE" attribute to the COVID-19 mention causing it to be excluded from consideration during the document classification process.

Each rule in the CSV file follows this format: regexPattern, Attribute


```
print_csv_file('postprocess_pattern_rules.csv')
```

    .*education.*#IGNORE
    .* \?#IGNORE
    (?=.*\b(?:deny|denies|denied)\b)(?=.*\b(?:contact|confirm)\b).*#IGNORE
    (?=.*\b(?:setting of|s/o)\b)(?!.*\b(?:COVID-19 infection|COVID-19 ards)\b).*#no_positive
    (?i)(.*benign.*)#uncertain
    admitted to COVID-19 unit#positive
    


```

```

```

    printing results for query 'CovidAttributes(Path, CovidSpan, CovidAttribute, Sent)':

     sample1.txt |  [40, 48)   |      positive       | His family recently tested positive for COVID-19 .
     sample3.txt |   [0, 8)    |      positive       |                 COVID-19 like_num
     sample4.txt |   [4, 12)   |       IGNORE        |              neg COVID-19 education .
     sample4.txt |   [4, 12)   |       future        |              neg COVID-19 education .
     sample4.txt |   [4, 12)   |       negated       |              neg COVID-19 education .
     sample5.txt |   [9, 17)   |       future        |           positive COVID-19 precaution .
     sample5.txt |   [9, 17)   |      positive       |           positive COVID-19 precaution .
     sample6.txt |  [26, 34)   | patient_experiencer |        The patient have reported COVID-19 .
    
    

#### 2) Postprocess rules utilizing existing attributes and patterns:
```
PostprocessingRule(
        patterns=[
        
            PostprocessingPattern(lambda ent: ent.label_ == "COVID-19"),
            PostprocessingPattern(
                postprocessing_functions.is_modified_by_category,
                condition_args=("DEFINITE_POSITIVE_EXISTENCE",),
            ),
            # PostprocessingPattern(postprocessing_functions.is_modified_by_category, condition_args=("TEST",)),
            PostprocessingPattern(
                postprocessing_functions.sentence_contains,
                condition_args=(
                    {
                        "should",
                        "unless",
                        "either",
                        "if comes back",
                        "if returns",
                        "if s?he tests positive",
                    },
                    True,
                ),
            ),
        ],
        action=set_is_uncertain,
        action_args=(True,),
        description="Subjunctive of test returning positive. 'Will contact patient should his covid-19 test return positive.'",
    ),
```
This rule examines whether a COVID-19 mention possesses a positive attribute and if the sentence containing it includes any of the words specified in 'condition_args' If these conditions are met, the uncertain attribute is set to true.


In our case, we check for each COVID-19 mention in the 'CovidAttributes' table if it's labeled as 'positive', also, we check if any of the specified words in 'condition_args' are present in the same sentence using a regex search. If the conditions are met, then we simply assign it an 'uncertain' attribute.

Each rule in the CSV file follows this format: regexPattern, ExistingAttribute, NewAttribute



```
print_csv_file('postprocess_attributes_rules.csv')
```

    .*pending.*#negated#no_negated
    .*(?:should|unless|either|if comes back|if returns|if s?he tests positive).*#positive#uncertain
    .*precaution.*#positive#no_future
    .*(?:re[ -]?test|second test|repeat).*#negated#no_negated
    .*(?:sign|symptom|s/s).*#positive#uncertain
    


```
magic_session.import_relation_from_csv("postprocess_attributes_rules.csv", relation_name="PostprocessRulesWithAttributes", delimiter="#")
```


```
%%rgxlog
PostprocessWithAttributesMatches(CovidAttribute, NewAttribute, Span, Path, Sent) <- Sents(Path, Sent), PostprocessRulesWithAttributes(Pattern, CovidAttribute, NewAttribute),\
py_rgx_span(Sent, Pattern) -> (Span)
?PostprocessWithAttributesMatches(CovidAttribute, NewAttribute, Span, Path, Sent)

#### 3) Postprocess rules applied to the next sentence:
There's a rule that checks if the following sentence contains positive mentions. If it does, the COVID-19 mentions in the current sentence are also
marked as positive. To Implement this rule in our project, we defined a new relation that pairs each sentence with its subsequent sentence.

### [Document Classifier](https://github.com/abchapman93/VA_COVID-19_NLP_BSV/blob/master/cov_bsv/knowledge_base/document_classifier.py):
Now we have the basic pieces in place to make our document classification. Each document is classified as either 'POS', 'UNK', or 'NEG' determined by the attributes of its COVID-19 mentions. The Results are stored in a DataFrame.

Document Classifier stage has 2 parts:
 1) **Attribute filtering**: Our pipeline assigns various attributes to each COVID-19 mention. However, during this stage, each COVID-19 case is refined to possess only one attribute. This filtering process operates based on specific conditions outlined in the 'attribute_filter' function.
 2) **Document classification**: Documents are classified based on distinct conditions, as detailed in the 'classify_doc_helper' function. This step ensures the accurate categorization of each document according to the specified criteria.



```
def attribute_filter(group):
    """
    Filters attributes within each "CovidSpan" of a DataFrame table based on specific conditions.

    Parameters:
        group (pandas.Series): A pandas Series representing attributes for each "CovidSpan" within a DataFrame.

            - If 'negated' is present (and 'no_negated' is not present), returns 'negated'.
            - If 'future' is present (and 'no_future' is not present), returns 'negated'.
            - If 'other experiencer' or 'not relevant' is present, returns 'negated'.
            - If 'positive' is present (and 'uncertain' and 'no_positive' are not present), returns 'positive'.

#### Handling unmentioned paths:
At this step, we assign a classification result 'UNK' to paths not identified in the previous DataFrame result. This occurs when our pipeline doesn't detect any mention of COVID-19 or its synonyms in the text of those paths. As a result, these paths are excluded from all types of relations, consistent with our primary focus on COVID-19 entities.

### Bringing It All Together

In this section, we will directly compare the original Python Spacy pipeline project with its rgxlog counterpart. Our emphasis is on showcasing the overall brevity of the rgxlog implementation in contrast to the Python Spacy pipeline.

#### Code Metrics

Let's commence by providing an estimated count of total lines in each implementation:

- **Total Number of Lines in the original Python implementation:** **4435**
- **Total Number of Lines in our rgxlog implementation:** **596** (7 times smaller!)<br>

And here's a detailed comparison:

![Screenshot%20%2825%29.png](covid_pipeline_files/Screenshot%20%2825%29.png)

Now, we will present the combined rgxlog and python code (excluding "generic ie" functions and excluding queries) to visually illustrate the compactness of the implementation:

#### Concept tagger:
```python
def lemmatize_text(text_path, lemma_words_path):
    # Define a list of words to be lemmatized
    lemma_words = [line.strip() for line in open(f"{lemma_words_path}") if line.strip()]

    with open(text_path, 'r') as file:
        contents = file.read()

    nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
    doc = nlp(contents)

    lemmatized_text = ""
    for token in doc:
        if token.lemma_ in lemma_words:
            lemmatized_text += token.lemma_
        elif token.like_num:
            lemmatized_text += "like_num"
        else:
            lemmatized_text += token.text
        lemmatized_text += " "

    # Write the lemmatized text back to the same file
    with open(text_path, 'w') as file:
        file.writelines(lemmatized_text)

    yield lemmatized_text

def annotate_text_with_pos(text_path):
    nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
    doc = nlp(contents)

    for token in doc:
        if token.pos_ in ["NOUN", "PROPN", "PRON", "ADJ"]:
            yield token.pos_, Span(token.idx, token.idx + len(token.text))
        else:
            yield tuple()
```

```python
session.import_relation_from_csv("concept_tags_rules.csv", relation_name="ConceptTagRules", delimiter=",")

%%rgxlog
LemmaMatches(Label, Span, Path) <- FilesContent(Path, Content), ConceptTagRules(Pattern, Label, "lemma"), py_rgx_span(Content, Pattern) -> (Span)

POSRuleMatches(Label, Span, Path) <- POSTable(POS, Span, Path), POSMatches(Label, Span, Path)
replace_spans("POSRuleMatches", "FilesPaths")
```

#### Target matcher:
```python
magic_session.import_relation_from_csv("target_rules.csv", relation_name="TargetTagRules", delimiter=",")

%%rgxlog
TargetTagMatches(Label, Span, Path) <- FilesContent(Path, Content), TargetTagRules(Pattern, Label), py_rgx_span(Content,Pattern) -> (Span)

```

#### Sectionizer:
```python

magic_session.import_relation_from_csv("section_rules.csv", relation_name="SectionRules", delimiter=",")

%%rgxlog
SectionRulesMatches(Label, Span, Path) <- FilesContent(Path, Content), SectionRules(Pattern, Label), py_rgx_span(Content,Pattern) -> (Span)
